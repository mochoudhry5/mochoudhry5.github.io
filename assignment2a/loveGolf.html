      <h1>Love For Golf</h1>
    <p> In this paragraph, I will briefly talk about my journey to the game of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank">golf</a>.
        I remember when my mother introduced me to golf, <strong> I hated it.</strong>  
        It was boring and really difficult to make friends as it is an individual sport. 
        But as I started getting older, my mother started signing me up for golf tournaments
        and all of a sudden, I became addicted to the competition aspect of the game. 
        When I was in these tournaments, I could not dependent on nobody else besides myself 
        and this created pressure I loved.
